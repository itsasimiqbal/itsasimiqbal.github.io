## About Me:
<p> A Computational Neuroscientist by training and a Machine Learning Engineer in practice. I aim to understand the anatomical and functional mysteries of brain to build rodent (and some day human)-level Artificial Intelligence and contribute towards building robust solutions for brain disorders. </p>

## Affiliation:
<p>I am currently serving as a Visiting Research Scientist at the Brain Research Institute (HiFo) and Neuroscience Center Zurich (ZNZ), <a href="https://www.neuroscience.uzh.ch/en.html"><img src="https://www.logolynx.com/images/logolynx/8d/8d76c0d2be0c548466bb3180b9caa83a.jpeg" width="110" height="25" /> </a> where I am pushing the efforts towards uncovering computational principles in the developing mouse cortex through Artificial Intelligence and Computational Neuroimaging.</p>

<p>As an Affiliate Faculty, I co-advise a small research group in the Department of Computer Science | SBASSE, <a href="https://sbasse.lums.edu.pk/department-of-computer-science"><img src="https://arawireless.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lums-logo.png" width="55" height="15" /> </a> where we aim to develop a novel deep neural network-based architecture inspired by the mouse visual cortex.</p>

<p>I also serve as a Technical Advisory Board Member in a few tech startups focused on Computer Vision and Machine Learning such as <a href="https://wizlabs.ai/" style="color:#253494">Wizlabs</a> and <a href="https://laam.pk/" style="color:#253494">LAAM</a>.</p>

### [SeBRe]: Segmenting Brain Regions with deep learning
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0058-8"><img src="/img/SeBRe_Cover_Hero_Image_NMI-1568x1136.jpg" align="left" width="330" height="215" /> </a>

</p>

<p>
  One of the main challenges faced by biologists in general and neuroscientists in partcular is to register mouse/human brain section images to a standard reference atlas. It requires an anatomical expert with a basic training to recognise and precisely annotate brain regions which is a very time consuming and exhausting process. Although, transformation algorithms have tackeled the automated brain image registration problem to a large extent but they still require fine tuning of parameters for any unseen brain section image. This fine tuning process easily takes hours as these algorithms are just trying to minimise a cost function to match the input image to a reference image. Furthermore, these algorithms are prone to errors and cannot simply work if any brain region is missing or distorted.
We introduce a concept of <b>registration through segmentation</b>: we train a deep learning model for instance segmentation to classify and segment all the brain regions in a given image with high accuracy. This approach is independent of data modality and can also serve to help generate an atlas for animal brain ages on which no anatomical atlas is pre-existed. Hence, developing a brain atlas through deep learning. Our study is published in <i>Nature Machine Intelligence</i> and made it to the cover of the journal.

### [DeNeRD]: Detecting Neurons in Regions of Development with deep learning
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nresearchnews/status/1178761193722392576"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFvNDwjWsAEwGyN?format=jpg&name=medium" align="left" width="250" height="140" /> </a>

</p>

<p>
  Neurons are captured with variability in shape, size, structure, intensity, etc. which becomes a challenge to detect them for high-throughput analysis of brain section images. We consider it as an object classification and detection problem and generated a ground-truth dataset of thousands of labelled neurons from mouse brain with different imaging modalities and genetic markers. We develop a deep neural network-based architecture to detect neurons in the entire 2D brain sections with high precision.
Our study is published in <i>Scientific Reports</i> and made it to the <i>Top 100 in Neuroscience</i>.

### Exploring the functional and anatomical motifs of developing mouse somatosensory cortex

  Two inhibitory cell types involved in modulating barrel cortex activity and perception during active whisking in adult mice, are the VIP+ and SST+ interneurons. Here we identify a developmental transition point of structural and functional rearrangements onto these interneuron types around the start of active sensation at P14. Using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we find that before P14, both interneuron types respond stronger to a multi-whisker stimulus, whereas after P14 their responses diverge, with VIP+ cells losing their multi-whisker preference and SST+ neurons enhancing theirs. Rabies virus tracings followed by tissue clearing, as well as photostimulation-coupled electrophysiology reveal that SST+ cells receive higher cross-barrel inputs compared to VIP+ at both time points. In addition, we also uncover that whereas prior to P14 both cell types receive direct input from the sensory thalamus, after P14 VIP+ cells show reduced inputs and SST+ cells largely shift to motor-related thalamic nuclei.
