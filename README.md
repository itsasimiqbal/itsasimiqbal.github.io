## About Me:
<p>
  I am working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational Neuroscience at

  . Prior to this, I finished my PhD in Computational Neuroscience on the topic: 'Exploring brain-wide development through deep learning' at Institut f端r Hirnforschung (HiFo) and Zentrum f端r Neurowissenschaften Z端rich (ZNZ) at UZH|ETH Z端rich. My PhD thesis was advised by Prof. Theofanis Karayannis along with Prof. Fritjof Helmchen and Prof. Mehmet Fatih Yanik as advisory committe members.</p>

<p> Before starting my PhD, I did Masters in Neural Systems and Computation at Institute of Neuroinformatics (
  <a href="http://www.ini.ethz.ch/"><img src="https://www.ini.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:b79ff425-53c5-4c72-83bd-93e81d3c6e94/neuroman_large.jpg" width="15" height="20" /> </a>
  ), Department of IT and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET), ETH Zurich and worked on enhancing scale-invariance in a convolutional neural network by introducing a neuro-inspired layer that mimics the functionality of complex neurons in the visual cortex. Moreover, I developed a robust framework to detect very fast moving objects in real-time through frame-based running deep neural network with an interface to a spike-based running neuromorphic retina sensor. My Master thesis was advised by Prof. Shih-Chii Liu, Prof. Tobi Delbruck and Prof. Rodney Douglas.</p>

<p> From Summer 2019 to Spring 2020, I worked as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Resident on a NeuroMoonshot at 
  <a href="https://x.company/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Google_X_Logo.png" width="62" height="25" /> </a>
  - The Moonshot Factory, Mountain View, California.
</p>

<p> In Summer of 2018, I attended Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain (SWDB) at
  <a href="https://x.company/"><img src="https://www.alleninstitute.org/static/images/logo_BS_header.png" width="90" height="20" /> </a>
  and
  <a href="https://x.company/"><img src="https://depts.washington.edu/mcklab/images/UW%20logo.jpg" width="90" height="20" /> </a>
  in Seattle, Washington and worked on developing a deep neural network-based decoder to predict neural responses in mouse visual cortex
</p>

<p> In Summer of 2016, I worked as a Research Intern with Brain-inspired Computing group on classification of hand gestures through deep learning and its implementation on TrueNorth neuromorphic chip at 
  <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/"><img src="https://www.swissre.com/.imaging/default/dam/institute/images-sri/images-sri-events/IBM-Research.jpg/jcr:content.jpg" width="92" height="11" />
  </a>
  - Almaden, San Jose, California.
</p>

<p> From Spring 2015 to Spring 2016, I worked as a Visiting Researcher in DiCarlo's lab, Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department, 
  <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/"><img src="https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/359-3591131_massachusetts-institute-of-technology-logo-png-transparent-png.png" width="72" height="20" />
  </a>at Cambridge, Massachusetts. I worked on predicting neural responses in primate visual cortex through performance optimzed deep neural networks.
