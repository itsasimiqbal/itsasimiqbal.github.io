## About Me:
<p>
  I am working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational Neuroscience at

  . Prior to this, I finished my PhD in Computational Neuroscience on the topic: 'Exploring brain-wide development through deep learning' at Institut für Hirnforschung (HiFo) and Zentrum für Neurowissenschaften Zürich (ZNZ) at UZH|ETH Zürich. My PhD thesis was advised by Prof. Theofanis Karayannis along with Prof. Fritjof Helmchen and Prof. Mehmet Fatih Yanik as advisory committe members.</p>

<p> Before starting my PhD, I did Masters in Neural Systems and Computation at Institute of Neuroinformatics (

  ), Department of IT and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET), ETH Zurich and worked on enhancing scale-invariance in a convolutional neural network by introducing a neuro-inspired layer that mimics the functionality of complex neurons in the visual cortex. Moreover, I developed a robust framework to detect very fast moving objects in real-time through frame-based running deep neural network with an interface to a spike-based running neuromorphic retina sensor. My Master thesis was advised by Prof. Shih-Chii Liu, Prof. Tobi Delbruck and Prof. Rodney Douglas.</p>

<p> I worked as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Resident on a NeuroMoonshot at
