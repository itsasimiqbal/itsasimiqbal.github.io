## About Me:
<p> A Computational Neuroscientist by heart and a Deep Learner in practice. I aim to uncover the computational mysteries of mind to build General Artificial Intelligence. </p>

## Education:
<p>I am working as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist on the intersection of AI and Neuroscience in <a href="http://www.mousemotorlab.org/" style="color:#253494">Mathis Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/cis/" style="color:#253494">Center for Intelligent Systems (CIS) | ELLIS Unit</a>, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Logo_EPFL.svg/330px-Logo_EPFL.svg.png" width="48.75" height="15" /></a>.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I briefly worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.neuroscience.uzh.ch/en.html"><img src="https://www.simplyscience.ch/assets/images/6/Logo_UZH_ETHZ-34d67296.jpg" width="125" height="20" /> </a> after finishing my PhD in <b>Computational Neuroscience</b> on the topic: '<b>Exploring brain-wide development through deep learning</b>' at Institut für Hirnforschung (HiFo) and Zentrum für Neurowissenschaften Zürich (ZNZ), UZH|ETH Zürich. My PhD thesis was advised by <a href="https://znznews.ch/understanding-the-developing-brain/" style="color:#253494">Prof. Theofanis Karayannis</a> along with <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html" style="color:#253494">Prof. Fritjof Helmchen</a> and <a href="https://neurotechnology.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjAzNTMz.TGlzdC8xODM1LDE3MjQ1MzA2Ng==.html" style="color:#253494">Prof. Mehmet Fatih Yanik</a> as advisory committe members. The focus of my PhD project was to develop deep learning-based tools to analyse neuro-imaging datasets which includes detection of neurons and generating an automated atlas for developing mouse and human brain sections captured through various imaging modalities. Morover, I worked on explaining the functional and anatomical correlates of neural responses in the mouse somatosensory and visual cortex.</p>

  ), Department of IT and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET), ETH Zürich and worked on '<b>Enhancing scale-invariance in a convolutional neural network</b>' as a thesis project by introducing a neuro-inspired layer in the deep neural network that mimics the functionality of complex cells in the visual cortex. Moreover, I developed a robust framework to detect very fast moving objects in real-time through frame-based running deep neural network with an interface to a spike-based running neuromorphic retina sensor.

### [SeBRe]: Segmenting Brain Regions with deep learning
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0058-8"><img src="/img/SeBRe_Cover_Hero_Image_NMI-1568x1136.jpg" align="left" width="330" height="215" /> </a>

  One of the main challenges faced by biologists in general and neuroscientists in partcular is to register mouse/human brain section images to a standard reference atlas. It requires an anatomical expert with a basic training to recognise and precisely annotate brain regions which is a very time consuming and exhausting process. Although, transformation algorithms have tackeled the automated brain image registration problem to a large extent but they still require fine tuning of parameters for any unseen brain section image. This fine tuning process easily takes hours as these algorithms are just trying to minimise a cost function to match the input image to a reference image. Furthermore, these algorithms are prone to errors and cannot simply work if any brain region is missing or distorted.
We introduce a concept of <b>registration through segmentation</b>: we train a deep learning model for instance segmentation to classify and segment all the brain regions in a given image with high accuracy. This approach is independent of data modality and can also serve to help generate an atlas for animal brain ages on which no anatomical atlas is pre-existed. Hence, developing a brain atlas through deep learning. Our study is published in <i>Nature Machine Intelligence</i> and made it to the cover of the journal.

### [DeNeRD]: Detecting Neurons in Regions of Development with deep learning

  Neurons are captured with variability in shape, size, structure, intensity, etc. which becomes a challenge to detect them for high-throughput analysis of brain section images. We consider it as an object classification and detection problem and generated a ground-truth dataset of thousands of labelled neurons from mouse brain with different imaging modalities and genetic markers. We develop a deep neural network-based architecture to detect neurons in the entire 2D brain sections with high precision.
Our study is published in <i>Scientific Reports</i> and made it to the <i>Top 100 in Neuroscience</i>.

### Exploring the functional and anatomical motifs of developing mouse somatosensory cortex

  Two inhibitory cell types involved in modulating barrel cortex activity and perception during active whisking in adult mice, are the VIP+ and SST+ interneurons. Here we identify a developmental transition point of structural and functional rearrangements onto these interneuron types around the start of active sensation at P14. Using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we find that before P14, both interneuron types respond stronger to a multi-whisker stimulus, whereas after P14 their responses diverge, with VIP+ cells losing their multi-whisker preference and SST+ neurons enhancing theirs. Rabies virus tracings followed by tissue clearing, as well as photostimulation-coupled electrophysiology reveal that SST+ cells receive higher cross-barrel inputs compared to VIP+ at both time points. In addition, we also uncover that whereas prior to P14 both cell types receive direct input from the sensory thalamus, after P14 VIP+ cells show reduced inputs and SST+ cells largely shift to motor-related thalamic nuclei.
The pre-print of our study is available in <i>bioRxiv</i>.
