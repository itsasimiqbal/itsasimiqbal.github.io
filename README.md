  . Prior to this, I finished my PhD in <b>Computational Neuroscience</b> on the topic: '<b>Exploring brain-wide development through deep learning</b>' at Institut für Hirnforschung (HiFo) and Zentrum für Neurowissenschaften Zürich (ZNZ), UZH|ETH Zürich. My PhD thesis was advised by Prof. Theofanis Karayannis along with Prof. Fritjof Helmchen and Prof. Mehmet Fatih Yanik as advisory committe members. The focus of my PhD project was to develop deep learning-based tools to analyse neuro-imaging datasets which includes detection of neurons and generating an automated atlas for developing mouse and human brain sections captured through various imaging modalities. Morover, I worked on explaining the functional and anatomical correlates of neural responses in the mouse somatosensory and visual cortex.</p>

<p> Before starting my PhD, I studied <b>Electrical Engineering</b> as an undergrad followed by a Masters in <b>Neural Systems and Computation</b> at the Institute of Neuroinformatics (
  <a href="http://www.ini.ethz.ch/"><img src="https://www.ini.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:b79ff425-53c5-4c72-83bd-93e81d3c6e94/neuroman_large.jpg" width="15" height="20" /> </a>
  ), Department of IT and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET), ETH Zürich and worked on '<b>Enhancing scale-invariance in a convolutional neural network</b>' as a thesis project by introducing a neuro-inspired layer in the deep neural network that mimics the functionality of complex cells in the visual cortex. Moreover, I developed a robust framework to detect very fast moving objects in real-time through frame-based running deep neural network with an interface to a spike-based running neuromorphic retina sensor. My Master thesis was advised by Prof. Shih-Chii Liu, Prof. Tobi Delbruck and Prof. Rodney Douglas.</p>

  One of the main challenges faced by biologists in general and neuroscientists in partcular is to register mouse/human brain section images to a standard reference atlas. It requires an anatomical expert with a basic training to recognise and precisely annotate brain regions which is a very time consuming and exhausting process. Although, transformation algorithms have tackeled the automated brain image registration problem to a large extent but they still require fine tuning of parameters for any unseen brain section image. This fine tuning process easily takes hours as these algorithms are just trying to minimise a cost function to match the input image to a reference image. Furthermore, these algorithms are prone to errors and cannot simply work if any brain region is missing or distorted.
We introduce a concept of <b>registration through segmentation</b>: we train a deep learning model for instance segmentation to classify and segment all the brain regions in a given image with high accuracy. This approach is independent of data modality and can also serve to help generate an atlas for animal brain ages on which no anatomical atlas is pre-existed. Hence, developing a brain atlas through deep learning. Our study is published in <i>Nature Machine Intelligence</i> and made it to the cover of the journal.

Computer vision is even helping analyze smaller-scale but high-volume images that examine neural death or protein levels. Rather than spending ridiculous man-hours on mindless work, researchers can focus on what’s important, solving the problem with more accurate results." </p>

"Segmenting and registration of brain imaging datasets can be a tedious and time-consuming task.

They trained a deep neural network to segment and classify eight different regions in the mouse brain. After training, SeBRe could segment and register other datasets with a precision of 0.84, and similar performance could be achieved even if the brains were stained for previously unseen markers or imaged with a different microscopy modality." </p>
