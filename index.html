      <p class="bio">
        I’m a PhD student (Fall’16 — Present) in the field of Computational Neuroscience and Machine Intelligence at HiFo and Neuroscience Centre Zurich (ZNZ), UZH/ETH Zurich. 
        My research work is focused on exploring the computational principles in the developing mouse brain, mainly to quantify the functional role of GABAergic interneurons in shaping the neural activity during the development of neuronal networks. 
        To answer this, I develop deep learning-based models to perform brain-wide analysis. I worked on decoding neural responses in mouse visual cortex through a deep neural network at Allen Institute of Brain Sciences and University of Washington, Seattle at Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain, 2018. 
        Prior to starting my PhD studies, I worked in the Brain-inspired computing team at IBM Research – Almaden in San Jose, CA. In between my Masters and PhD studies, I also worked as a researcher in DiCarlo’s lab, Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at MIT, Cambridge, MA. 
        I graduated with Masters in Neural Systems and Computation from Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Switzerland in 2015 with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from Lahore, Pakistan. 
        My Master’s thesis work was focused on exploring the functional properties of complex cells in primate’s visual cortex for developing a biologically realistic deep neural network, and integrate it with a neuromorphic retina chip for real-time object localisation application. 
        During my Masters studies, I also worked as a part-time Research Assistant in Laboratory of Neural Circuit Dynamics with Prof. Jerry Chen at HiFo (Brain Research Institute), UZH.
